I am a web developer who is interested in both backend and frontend development. I have been teaching myself web development and am familiar with programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks like React and Node.js. I am eager to gain practical experience and am looking for entry-level or freelance opportunities to build my skills and contribute to the development of high-quality websites.
